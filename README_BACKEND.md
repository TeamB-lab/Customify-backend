# Backend Service (Node.js + Express API) Documentation 
 
This document outlines the purpose and access scope of the Customify application's backend service. 
 
## Programmer Capabilities 
 
As the development team, programmers have full control over: 
* Developing and managing **backend logic** (API endpoints, business rules). 
* Implementing and managing the **database connection** and all data transactions with PostgreSQL. 
* System configuration and continuous deployment (CD) via GitHub Actions and Render. 
 
## User Capabilities 
 
Direct user access to this backend service is not intended. The user's interaction is mediated entirely through the frontend application. 
The most a user can do is **refresh the page to view data** that has been successfully retrieved by this backend from the database and formatted for display.
